# Newsletter Curator - Project Specification

## Project Overview

A system that processes AI-related newsletters, scores items against Kurt's interests, checks for duplicates in his Notion vault, and presents a weekly digest via a web interface. Kurt reviews and approves items, which then get saved directly to Notion.

**Owner:** Kurt Farasyn
**Approach:** Step-by-step development, learning-focused. Kurt wants to understand each module before moving to the next. Explain clearly, build incrementally, test together.

## Kurt's Profile (for the LLM scoring prompt)

### Interests (score +3 each)
- AI agents & workflows
- Python libraries
- DuckDB ecosystem
- RAG / knowledge graphs
- Local LLMs / inference
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- Graph theory
- Coding tools / vibe coding
- AI productivity tools (NotebookLM, Canva AI, Notion AI, Flourish, Gamma)
- PostgreSQL (learned from feedback)

### Context
- ERP/BC consultant with 25 years experience
- Technical but not a professional developer
- Builds Python projects with AI assistance (Claude Code)
- Wants practical, usable tools and knowledge

### Rejection criteria (score -3 each)
- Domain-specific tools for other industries (real estate, HR, legal, etc.)
- Pure consumer/entertainment AI
- Marketing fluff without real artifacts (repo/docs/demo)
- Enterprise dev tooling requiring large teams
- Content that's too basic ("What is AI?")
- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)

## Scoring System

### Positive signals
| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Matches core interest domain | +3 |
| Has real artifact (repo/docs/demo) | +2 |
| Similar to previously accepted items | +2 |
| New version of something in vault | +2 |
| From trusted source | +1 |
| Practical/actionable | +1 |

### Negative signals
| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Out of scope domain | -3 |
| Duplicate, no new info | -3 |
| No artifact, just landing page | -2 |
| Similar to previously rejected items | -2 |
| Marketing heavy, substance light | -2 |
| Listicle with no depth | -1 |

### Thresholds
| Score | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 5+ | ⭐⭐ Strong fit | Auto-propose |
| 3-4 | ⭐ Likely fit | Propose with review |
| 1-2 | 🟡 Maybe | Show in maybe list |
| 0 or below | ❌ Reject | Skip (log reason) |

---

## Duplicate Handling

### Three levels
1. **Within newsletter batch** — dedupe by normalized URL
2. **Across newsletter sources** — same item from multiple newsletters
3. **Against Notion vault** — check all 14 databases

### When duplicate found
- **Exact match, no new info** → Flag as "Already in vault" (skip)
- **Match with new info** → Flag as "Update candidate" (propose update)

### What counts as "new info"
- Version bump (v1.2 → v2.0)
- New capability announced
- Major update (new API, features)

---

## Relation Handling

### Auto-link
When related entries exist in Notion, automatically link them.

### Propose creation
When a secondary entry makes sense (e.g., tool is also a Python library), propose:
> "Cognee is also a Python package. Create entry in Python Libraries? [Yes/No]"

Don't auto-create — always ask.

---

## Feedback & Learning

### What gets stored
Every accept/reject decision with:
- Item details
- Curator's verdict
- Your decision
- Timestamp

### How system learns

**Option C (immediate):** Recent overrides included in LLM prompt as examples.

**Option A (accumulating):** When pattern detected (e.g., 4+ Postgres accepts), propose rule update:
> "Add PostgreSQL to interests? [Yes/No]"

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal:** Basic infrastructure, prove concepts work

1. **Module: Notion client wrapper**
   - Query databases
   - Create entries
   - Update entries
   - Create relations
   - Test with one database (e.g., Books & Papers)

2. **Module: Dedup index**
   - Load entries from all databases
   - Build searchable index (names, URLs)
   - Fuzzy matching function
   - Test: "Does Marimo exist?" → Yes, in Python Libraries

### Phase 2: Email & Content
**Goal:** Fetch and process newsletters

3. **Module: M365 email fetcher**
   - Microsoft Graph API authentication
   - Fetch emails from newsletter folder
   - Extract URLs and text
   - Store raw items in SQLite

4. **Module: Content extractor**
   - Fetch URL content
   - Playwright setup for Medium (with login)
   - Extract article text
   - Handle different sources (GitHub, docs, blogs)

### Phase 3: Intelligence
**Goal:** Score and route items

5. **Module: Scorer**
   - Build the scoring prompt
   - Call LLM (Claude API)
   - Parse response
   - Calculate final score

6. **Module: Router**
   - Determine item type
   - Select target database
   - Find related entries
   - Propose relations

### Phase 4: Interface
**Goal:** Web UI for review

7. **Module: Digest database**
   - SQLite schema for pending items
   - Feedback history table
   - Pattern detection queries

8. **Module: Reflex web app**
   - Digest list view
   - Item detail view (clickable)
   - Accept/reject buttons
   - Edit fields before saving
   - View original article link

### Phase 5: Integration
**Goal:** End-to-end flow

9. **Module: Notion writer**
   - Save approved items
   - Create relations
   - Handle update vs. create

10. **Module: Scheduler**
    - Weekly run trigger
    - n8n integration (optional)
    - Or Python scheduler (APScheduler)

### Phase 6: Learning
**Goal:** System improves over time

11. **Module: Feedback processor**
    - Track overrides
    - Detect patterns
    - Propose rule updates
    - Update prompt examples

## How to Work on This Project

For each module:

1. **Explain** what the module needs to do — make sure Kurt understands the concept
2. **Create** the file with clear comments explaining each part
3. **Test** with a simple example
4. **Review** together — Kurt should understand before moving on
5. **Iterate** if needed

Kurt is learning as he builds. Don't rush ahead. One module at a time.

Example start:
> "Let's work on the Notion client wrapper. First, I'll explain what functions we need, then create src/notion/client.py with clear comments. We'll start simple — just the function to query a database. We'll add more later."

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can fetch emails from M365 newsletter folder
- [ ] Can extract content from Medium with login
- [ ] Can check Notion for duplicates across all databases
- [ ] Can score items with LLM
- [ ] Can route items to correct database
- [ ] Web interface shows digest
- [ ] Clicking item shows details
- [ ] Accept saves to Notion with relations
- [ ] Feedback is stored
- [ ] System suggests rule improvements over time

---

## Note for Claude Code

Kurt is not a professional developer, but he is technical and wants to learn. Always:
- Explain concepts before implementing
- Add clear comments in code
- Keep modules focused and simple
- Test each piece before moving on
- Ask if something is unclear before proceeding
